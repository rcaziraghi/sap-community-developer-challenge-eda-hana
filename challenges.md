# Challenges

Every Wednesday of each week of the challenge you will get a new challenge added to this page.

Here you will get a new Jupyter notebook with the code that you must successfully execute. The code might be incorrect or incomplete, and it is a challenge for you to fix/complete the notebook and to share your successfully completed notebook.

Once you successfuly execute a complete notebook, please submit your result as a link to your saved Jupyter notebook or a screenshot of your completed notebook in the thread on SAP Community Group relevant for the given week.

A link can point to that file in your public repository, or in a public share of your cloud storage (like OneDrive, DropBox, GDrive etc), or in a public notebook software (like CoLab, Binders etc) -- depending what you are using and what you are familiar with.

These challenges must be concluded and the submission fulfilled in order to have your submission counted towards the month's total progression. Read the challenges for each week carefully.

**Enjoy learning something new! ðŸ˜Š**

## Week 1 (starts on 2023-03-08)

This week's challenge is about you [getting everything set up](README.md#setup-for-the-challenge) and working! 

You can find [`week1.ipynb`](notebooks/challenges/week1.ipynb) Jupyter notebook file in [`notebooks/challenges`](notebooks/challenges/) of this repo.

Execute that simple Jupyter notebook to verify the setup works and you can connect to your SAP HANA database instance using a database user from Python using Python machine learning client for SAP HANA (`hana-ml`).

Share the result (as described above) in the thread [Submissions for "EDA with SAP HANA" developer challenge: Week 1 - Setup](https://groups.community.sap.com/t5/application-development/submissions-for-quot-eda-with-sap-hana-quot-developer-challenge/m-p/223607/highlight/true#M1109)

## Week 2 (starts on 2023-03-15)

This week's challenge is about getting understanding of [HANA DataFrames](https://help.sap.com/doc/cd94b08fe2e041c2ba778374572ddba9/2022_4_QRC/en-US/hana_ml.html#sap-hana-dataframe) in the `hana_ml` package, how they are different from calling SQL using a plain [SAP HANA Client's Python Driver](https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_HANA_CLIENT/f1b440ded6144a54ada97ff95dac7adf/f3b8fabf34324302b123297cdbe710f0.html), and how HANA DataFrames work with [Pandas DataFrames](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/getting_started/intro_tutorials/01_table_oriented.html#pandas-data-table-representation)! 

You can find [`week2.ipynb`](notebooks/challenges/week2.ipynb) Jupyter notebook file in [`notebooks/challenges`](notebooks/challenges/) of this repo.

Execute that Jupyter notebook after fixing a few errors in the code in it.

Share the result (as described above) in the thread [Submissions for "EDA with SAP HANA" developer challenge: Week 2 - DataFrames](https://groups.community.sap.com/t5/application-development/submissions-for-quot-eda-with-sap-hana-quot-developer-challenge/m-p/224446/highlight/true#M1129)

## Week 3 (starts on 2023-03-22)

This week's challenge is about getting understanding of data represented by [HANA DataFrames](https://help.sap.com/doc/cd94b08fe2e041c2ba778374572ddba9/2022_4_QRC/en-US/hana_ml.html#sap-hana-dataframe) in the `hana_ml` package! 

You can find [`week3.ipynb`](notebooks/challenges/week3.ipynb) Jupyter notebook file in [`notebooks/challenges`](notebooks/challenges/) of this repo.

Execute that Jupyter notebook after fixing all errors in its code cells.

Share the result (as described above) in the thread [Submissions for "EDA with SAP HANA" developer challenge: Week 3 - Querying](https://groups.community.sap.com/t5/application-development/submissions-for-quot-eda-with-sap-hana-quot-developer-challenge/m-p/225900/highlight/true#M1181)

## Content for the Week 4 will come on 2023-03-29
